I am Yuki Shirai, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://www.merl.com/) (MERL). I have been working on dexterous manipulation and locomotion from bimanual whole-body manipulation to tool manipulation, using deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and trajectory optimization, using vision and touch sensing toward multimodal learning.

Before joining MERL, I completed my Ph.D. at UCLA, working with [Dennis Hong](https://www.romela.org/) and I completed my B.E. at Tohoku University, working with [Kazuya Yoshida](https://astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/e/index.html). 

Previously, during my PhD, I worked at [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/) and MERL as a research intern.
