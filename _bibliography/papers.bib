  abstract={Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer.},

  abstract={Humans can effortlessly perform very complex, dexterous manipulation tasks by reacting to sensor observations. In contrast, robots can not perform reactive manipulation and they mostly operate in open-loop while interacting with their environment. Consequently, the current manipulation algorithms either are inefficient in performance or can only work in highly structured environments. In this paper, we present closed-loop control of a complex manipulation task where a robot uses a tool to interact with objects. Manipulation using a tool leads to complex kinematics and contact constraints that need to be satisfied for generating feasible manipulation trajectories. We first present an open-loop controller design using Non-Linear Programming (NLP) that satisfies these constraints. In order to design a closed-loop controller, we present a pose estimator of objects and tools using tactile sensors. Using our tactile estimator, we design a closed-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed algorithm is verified using a 6 DoF manipulator on tasks using a variety of objects and tools. We verify that our closed-loop controller can successfully perform tool manipulation under several unexpected contacts.},

  abstract={Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.},

  abstract={Designing trajectories for manipulation through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning of object & robot trajectories as well as complex contact sequences simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot & object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system.},

  abstract={Generalizable manipulation requires that robots be able to interact with novel objects and environment. This requirement makes manipulation extremely challenging as a robot has to reason about complex frictional interactions with uncertainty in physical properties of the object and the environment. In this article, we study robust optimization for planning of pivoting manipulation in the presence of uncertainties. We present insights about how friction can be exploited to compensate for inaccuracies in the estimates of the physical properties during manipulation. Under certain assumptions, we derive analytical expressions for stability margin provided by friction during pivoting manipulation. This margin is then used in a contact implicit bilevel optimization framework to optimize a trajectory that maximizes this stability margin to provide robustness against uncertainty in several physical parameters of the object. We present analysis of the stability margin with respect to several parameters involved in the underlying bilevel optimization problem. We demonstrate our proposed method using a 6 DoF manipulator for manipulating several different objects. We also design and validate an MPC controller using the proposed algorithm which can track and regulate the position of the object during manipulation.},

  abstract={While motion planning of locomotion for legged robots has shown great success, motion planning for legged robots with dexterous multi-finger grasping is not mature yet. We present an efficient motion planning framework for simultaneously solving locomotion (e.g., centroidal dynamics), grasping (e.g., patch contact), and contact (e.g., gait) problems. To accelerate the planning process, we propose distributed optimization frameworks based on Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the original large-scale Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP). The resulting frameworks use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to solve contact and NonLinear Programming (NLP) to solve nonlinear dynamics, which are more computationally tractable and less sensitive to parameters. Also, we explicitly enforce patch contact constraints from limit surfaces with micro-spine grippers. We demonstrate our proposed framework in the hardware experiments, showing that the multi-limbed robot is able to realize various motions including free-climbing at a slope angle 45Â° with a much shorter planning time.},

  abstract={Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.},

  abstract={This article presents Spine-enhanced Climbing Autonomous Limbed Exploration Robot (SCALER), a versatile free-climbing multilimbed robot that is designed to achieve tightly coupled simultaneous locomotion and dexterous grasping. While existing quadrupedal-limbed robots have demonstrated impressive dexterous capabilities, achieving a balance between power-demanding locomotion and precise grasping remains a critical challenge. We design a torso mechanism and a parallelâ€“serial limb to meet the conflicting requirements that pose unique challenges in hardware design. SCALER employs underactuated two-fingered GOAT grippers that can mechanically adapt and offer seven modes of grasping, enabling SCALER to traverse extreme terrains with multimodal grasping strategies. We study the whole-body approach, where SCALER utilizes its body and limbs to generate additional forces for stable grasping in various environments, thereby further enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we improve the GOAT gripper actuation speed to realize more dynamic climbing in a closed-loop control fashion. With these proposed technologies, SCALER can traverse vertical, overhanging, upside-down, slippery terrains and bouldering walls with nonconvex-shaped climbing holds under the Earthâ€™s gravity.},

  abstract={We present a motion planning algorithm with probabilistic guarantees for limbed robots with stochastic gripping forces. Planners based on deterministic models with a worst-case uncertainty can be conservative and inflexible to consider the stochastic behavior of the contact, especially when a gripper is installed. Our proposed planner enables the robot to simultaneously plan its pose and contact force trajectories while considering the risk associated with the gripping forces. Our planner is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with chance constraints, which allows the robot to generate a variety of motions based on different risk bounds. To model the gripping forces as random variables, we employ Gaussian Process regression. We validate our proposed motion planning algorithm on an 11.5Â kg six-limbed robot for two-wall climbing. Our results show that our proposed planner generates various trajectories (e.g., avoiding low friction terrain under the low risk bound, choosing an unstable but faster gait under the high risk bound) by changing the probability of risk based on various specifications.},

  abstract={In this letter, we present a passive spine gripper that can hold rough rocky surfaces of boulders on cliff walls, and we discuss its application to a four-limbed robot for free-climbing in extreme terrain. The limbed robot has four degrees of freedom in each limb, where three are to drive joints of the limb and one for releasing the gripper. The fine spine of the proposed gripper also enables it to passively and adaptively latch on to microscopic asperities of the rough surface, and it is thus an efficient mechanism. In this letter, we present the fundamental design and mechanism of the proposed gripper, after which we introduce its static gripping model. We verify the gripping model by the experimental gripping performance of the prototype gripper. We show a lightweight four-limbed robot that is equipped with the grippers mounted on each limb. To evaluate the climbing capabilities of the robot, we use it to perform climbing experiments on a rugged and steep slope. The results show that the prototype can safely climb over such challenging terrain that is similar to a gravity offload system.},

Thus, we demonstrate an admittance controller with auto-tuning that can be applied for these systems. The controller's objective is to track the target wrench profiles of each contact point while considering the additional torque due to rotational friction. Our admittance controller is adaptive during online operation by using an auto-tuning method that tunes the gains of the controller while following user-specified training objectives. These objectives include facilitating controller stability, such as tracking the wrench profiles as closely as possible, ensuring control outputs are within force limits that minimize slippage, and avoiding configurations that induce kinematic singularity.

  abstract={In this paper we present a motion planner for LIMMS, a modular multi-agent, multi-modal package delivery platform. A single LIMMS unit is a robot that can operate as an arm or leg depending on how and what it is attached to, e.g., a manipulator when it is anchored to walls within a delivery vehicle or a quadruped robot when 4 are attached to a box. Coordinating amongst multiple LIMMS, when each one can take on vastly different roles, can quickly become complex. For such a planning problem we first compose the necessary logic and constraints. The formulation is then solved for skill exploration and can be implemented on hardware after refinement. To solve this optimization problem we use alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The proposed planner is experimented under various scenarios which shows the capability of LIMMS to enter into different modes or combinations of them to achieve their goal of moving shipping boxes.},

  year={2022},

  abstract={Generalizable manipulation requires that robots be able to interact with novel objects and environment. This requirement makes manipulation extremely challenging as a robot has to reason about complex frictional interaction with uncertainty in physical properties of the object. In this paper, we study robust optimization for control of pivoting manipulation in the presence of uncertainties. We present insights about how friction can be exploited to compensate for the inaccuracies in the estimates of the physical properties during manipulation. In particular, we derive analytical expressions for stability margin provided by friction during pivoting manipulation. This margin is then used in a bilevel trajectory optimization algorithm to design a controller that maximizes this stability margin to provide robustness against uncertainty in physical properties of the object. We demonstrate our proposed method using a 6 DoF manipulator for manipulating several different objects.},
