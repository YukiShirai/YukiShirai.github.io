  abstract={Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer.},

  abstract={Humans can effortlessly perform very complex, dexterous manipulation tasks by reacting to sensor observations. In contrast, robots can not perform reactive manipulation and they mostly operate in open-loop while interacting with their environment. Consequently, the current manipulation algorithms either are inefficient in performance or can only work in highly structured environments. In this paper, we present closed-loop control of a complex manipulation task where a robot uses a tool to interact with objects. Manipulation using a tool leads to complex kinematics and contact constraints that need to be satisfied for generating feasible manipulation trajectories. We first present an open-loop controller design using Non-Linear Programming (NLP) that satisfies these constraints. In order to design a closed-loop controller, we present a pose estimator of objects and tools using tactile sensors. Using our tactile estimator, we design a closed-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed algorithm is verified using a 6 DoF manipulator on tasks using a variety of objects and tools. We verify that our closed-loop controller can successfully perform tool manipulation under several unexpected contacts.},

  abstract={Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.},

  abstract={Designing trajectories for manipulation through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning of object & robot trajectories as well as complex contact sequences simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot & object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system.},

  abstract={Generalizable manipulation requires that robots be able to interact with novel objects and environment. This requirement makes manipulation extremely challenging as a robot has to reason about complex frictional interactions with uncertainty in physical properties of the object and the environment. In this article, we study robust optimization for planning of pivoting manipulation in the presence of uncertainties. We present insights about how friction can be exploited to compensate for inaccuracies in the estimates of the physical properties during manipulation. Under certain assumptions, we derive analytical expressions for stability margin provided by friction during pivoting manipulation. This margin is then used in a contact implicit bilevel optimization framework to optimize a trajectory that maximizes this stability margin to provide robustness against uncertainty in several physical parameters of the object. We present analysis of the stability margin with respect to several parameters involved in the underlying bilevel optimization problem. We demonstrate our proposed method using a 6 DoF manipulator for manipulating several different objects. We also design and validate an MPC controller using the proposed algorithm which can track and regulate the position of the object during manipulation.},

  abstract={While motion planning of locomotion for legged robots has shown great success, motion planning for legged robots with dexterous multi-finger grasping is not mature yet. We present an efficient motion planning framework for simultaneously solving locomotion (e.g., centroidal dynamics), grasping (e.g., patch contact), and contact (e.g., gait) problems. To accelerate the planning process, we propose distributed optimization frameworks based on Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the original large-scale Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP). The resulting frameworks use Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to solve contact and NonLinear Programming (NLP) to solve nonlinear dynamics, which are more computationally tractable and less sensitive to parameters. Also, we explicitly enforce patch contact constraints from limit surfaces with micro-spine grippers. We demonstrate our proposed framework in the hardware experiments, showing that the multi-limbed robot is able to realize various motions including free-climbing at a slope angle 45° with a much shorter planning time.},

  abstract={Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the literature.},
